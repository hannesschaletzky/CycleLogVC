# CycleLogVC
This app is a functional (not an UI) prototype of a GPS Tracker. The user can record her/his GPS Location and it will be saved to core data. The user can also   push the recorded GPS Locations to a backend as soon as there is a stable internet connection. Next step would be: setup a webpage to share your journey and stops including photos with others.
