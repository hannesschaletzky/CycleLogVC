This app is a functional prototype of a GPS Tracker. The user can record her/his GPS Location and it will be saved to core data. The user can also then manually push the new GPS Locations to a backend as soon as there is a working connection. Next step would be to setup a webpage to share your journey and stops including photos with others.
